## General Information
I started this project in order to understand how SwiftUI and UIKit can be integrated together to get the best out of both of them. 

This is actually just one of two projects that I worked on, you can find the "UIKit in SwiftUI" part [here](https://github.com/BarbaraBeatrice/UIKit-in-SwiftUI/blob/main/README.md).
